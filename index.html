    <p class="long-text">Another pararaph that I am not sure what to write about. I think coding is very interesting. It is something new to me and it is very different from my current job. It's been a hectic time lately since I am still working on my current job and trying to learn coding at the same time but the August month ends soon so in September I will start being off duty from my work so I can focus more on learning about coding.  </p>
